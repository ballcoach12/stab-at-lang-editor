# `stab-at-lang-editor`

This project is a prototype for running an editor and language server, that was generated by Langium, in a browser.  The idea is to wrap the editor in a Lit WebComponent so that it can be packaged for reuse.

## Project Structure

This project uses an `npm` workspace.  The projects contained in the workspace are in the `packages` folder. The project consists of:

### `hello-world`

A small Langium language server/editor project that implements a simple "HelloWorld" grammar.  When you build this project, it is configured to produce a web worker that can be used in the browser to move the language server from a Node backend into the browser itself, eliminating the need for a server-based language server.

### `wrapper`

The initial stab at making the `hello-world` language editor available outside the original `hello-world` project itself. This will form the basis for the eventual Lit component that provides the editor and language server to the browser.

### `hello-world-lit`

The eventual Lit component project.

## Building  the parent package

```
cd stab-at-lang-editor
npm run clean
npm run build:all
```

## Running the wrapper in the browser

**Be sure to build the parent package first**
```
cd stab-at-lang-editor/packages/wrapper
npm run dev
```
## Running only the langugage editor and server in the browser

```
cd stab-at-lang-editor/packages/hello-world
npm run buildall
npm run serve
```
